# rtc-solidity-workshop
Code for the RTC solidity workshop
Here we will look at privacy (using basic cryptography) in Ethereum from the lens of an NFT smart contract.
## Setup
No setup is required for this workshop. We will be using the Remix IDE to write and deploy our smart contracts.

## IPFS Setup
We will be using IPFS to store our NFTs. You can download the IPFS desktop app here: https://ipfs.io/#install
You can also just use this as your token `uri` `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaHvtFEn1B3f7u9TtfLAkyBrRSoKrCF646BjmDum4sL4s?filename=`
