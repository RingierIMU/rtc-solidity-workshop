# trac-solidity-workshop
Code for the TRAC solidity workshop
Here we will look at privacy (using basic cryptography) in Ethereum from the lens of an NFT smart contract.
## Setup
No setup is required for this workshop. We will be using the Remix IDE to write and deploy our smart contracts.
https://remix.ethereum.org/
## Merkle tree setup
To add addresses to the Merkel tree edit the file 4_merkel_tree/merkle_proof.js
```javascript
let addresses = [
    "0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4",
    "0xea674fdde714fd979de3edf0f56aa9716b898ec8",
    "0x7E5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf",
    "0x3CB39EA2f14B16B69B451719A7BEd55e0aFEcE8F"
];
```
Be sure to run npm install before running the script.

## IPFS Setup
We will be using IPFS to store our NFTs. You can download the IPFS desktop app here: https://ipfs.io/#install
You can also just use this as your token `uri` `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmchKUshCbfshdC378EZ55Cg7kVdYJzdRH5Nygu8ZZqCFS/`
## Stealth Address Setup
The scripts for stealth addresses are in 5_stealth_address/
Be sure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the script.
## Goerlli faucet
In order to test our code on a testnet, we need to deploy to the Goerli network (we use Goerli because it's recognised by opensea ü§¶üèΩ).
This, however requires gas. On the day you can either use the below faucet to get some testnet ETH or ask me, and I'll send some.

Generally testnet ETH on Georli network is difficult to come across.
## opensea account
To view your newly minted NFT on the Goerli network, connect your wallet with opensea.
